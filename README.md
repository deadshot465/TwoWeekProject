## Project Setup

### Setup steps

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deadshot465/TwoWeekProject
   ```

2. You should be able to restore the dependencies using Visual Studio. Alternatively, run:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Open up the project and start executing/debugging, see if the game window opens.

## Development Notice

Creating a new branch is recommended. And every time when we want to merge something, we should assign each other as a reviewer and see if there are conflicts.
